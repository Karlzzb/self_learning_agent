# Triage Labels

The skills speak in terms of five canonical triage roles. This file maps those roles to the actual label strings used in this repo's issue tracker. This repo uses the canonical defaults.

Since the tracker is local markdown, a label is applied by writing a `Status:` line near the top of the issue file (e.g. `Status: ready-for-agent`).

| Canonical role    | Label in our tracker | Meaning                                  |
| ----------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `needs-triage`    | `needs-triage`       | Maintainer needs to evaluate this issue  |
| `needs-info`      | `needs-info`         | Waiting on reporter for more information |
| `ready-for-agent` | `ready-for-agent`    | Fully specified, ready for an AFK agent  |
| `ready-for-human` | `ready-for-human`    | Requires human implementation            |
| `wontfix`         | `wontfix`            | Will not be actioned                     |

When a skill mentions a role (e.g. "apply the AFK-ready triage label"), write the corresponding string into the issue's `Status:` line.

Edit the right-hand column to match whatever vocabulary you actually use.
